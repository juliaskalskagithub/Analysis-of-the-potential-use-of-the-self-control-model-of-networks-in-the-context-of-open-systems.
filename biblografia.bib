            Machine learning is a branch of computer science that has the potential to transform epidemiologic sciences. Amid a growing focus on “Big Data,” it offers epidemiologists new tools to tackle problems for which classical methods are not well-suited. In order to critically evaluate the value of integrating machine learning algorithms and existing methods, however, it is essential to address language and technical barriers between the two fields that can make it difficult for epidemiologists to read and assess machine learning studies. Here, we provide an overview of the concepts and terminology used in machine learning literature, which encompasses a diverse set of tools with goals ranging from prediction to classification to clustering. We provide a brief introduction to 5 common machine learning algorithms and 4 ensemble-based approaches. We then summarize epidemiologic applications of machine learning techniques in the published literature. We recommend approaches to incorporate machine learning in epidemiologic research and discuss opportunities and challenges for integrating machine learning and existing epidemiologic research methods.},

	abstract = {"Cognitive Radio, Software Defined Radio and Adaptive Wireless Systems" is aimed to discuss the cognitive radio, software defined radio (SDR), and adaptive radio concepts from several aspects. Cognitive radio and cognitive networks will be investigated from a broad aspect of wireless communication system enhancement while giving special emphasis on better spectrum utilization. Applications of cognitive radio, SDR and cognitive radio architectures, spectrum efficiency and soft spectrum usage, adaptive wireless system design, measurements and awareness of various parameters including interference temperature and geo-location information are some the important topics that will be covered in this book. "Cognitive Radio, Software Defined Radio and Adaptive Wireless Systems" is both an introductory technology survey/tutorial for beginners and an advanced mathematical overview intended for technical professionals in the communications industry, technical managers, and researchers in both academia and industry},
